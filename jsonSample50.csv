I would like to have more self-discipline when it comes to my lifestyle. I don’t feel confident or know how and where to start building a routine,"Hello!

Acknowledging a need or a lack of something in one’s life is a brave and necessary first step to getting better, and I’m glad you’ve already taken it! Wanting to have more self-discipline is a pretty healthy desire! But, it’s not a cakewalk getting our life in order.

And that’s the first thing I’d like you to know - getting self-discipline with your lifestyle is not a linear journey. There are days when it seems easy to make healthier choices and days when you may just want to curl up in bed and eat ice cream straight out of the tub. Going through these waves in your health journey is common and expected.

You seem to have identified a lack of self-confidence - you don’t feel confident in building a routine for yourself, and so you sabotage all your efforts. I wonder what else there is to this pattern. Where does the lack of self-confidence come from? 

Let me give you some food for thought before you answer…

Many people start their ~~health~~ journey with a specific goal - maybe they want to lose some weight; maybe they want to get on a diet or be able to run a certain length or work and sleep at a particular time. While these specific and concrete goals help us get started, we may need more motivation once we meet them. For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds and you manage to do that in a month, you may no longer feel motivated to go further.

Another common reason to lose motivation is setting unsustainable routines. For example, sustaining it may be extremely difficult if you’ve gone from having dessert daily to completely cutting off sugar.

Yet another reason for giving up is when we don’t see obvious results quickly. We may feel that we’re not doing it right or will never meet our goals and give up.

Can you relate to any of this? If not, that’s alright.",guided_journaling,What do you think are your current goals when it comes to self-discipline?

"I have a hard time finding the motivation or reason to do the things I want to do so badly. I am always coming up with excuses, I am always procrastinating. I am unable to achieve the things I want most out of my life","Hi there!

One of the hardest things to do is to set realistic and achievable expectations. But it’s so so important to figure out how to do this. Because when we set unrealistically high expectations for ourselves, we inadvertently set ourselves up for failure.

Of course, there’s always scope for improvement. Even the best can get better because better, by definition, is relative. It’s not a static destination you can reach and check off your list.

But at what point does it become enough?

We often underestimate the value of ‘enough.’ Enough is that sweet spot where we’re fulfilling our potential, have a balance between input and output, and can enjoy different aspects of life - work, recreation, relationships, and good health.",guided_journaling,What does your ‘enough’ look like?,guided_journaling,Where do you think your lack of motivation is coming from?,guided_journaling,What does emotional regulation look like for you?,practice_breathing,breathing_4_x_4,,,,,,,,
I tend to feel shame and guilt when I procrastinate getting things done. I just feel annoyed and anxious about myself,"Pushing work for later can feel unsettling at times, right? Although we procrastinate for various reasons, it often always leaves us feeling annoyed or guilty. In this mini-therapy, we will reflect on those reasons and how to regulate emotions to overcome them. Let’s go!

Let's start by meditating on the reasons behind your procrastination.",practice_awareness,What thoughts or emotions arise when you think about the tasks you need to complete? Take a deep breath and let these thoughts and emotions come to you. Remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge these feelings. I’ll give you some time.,reflective_questions,Reflect on your previous experiences with procrastination and consider what might be causing it.

I want to know how to navigate differences in my relationship but not be so easily affected by the conflicts - it impacts my mood devastatingly and I don't know how to recover from the arguments,"I am so happy to see you here! I see that you are having difficulty navigating differences in your relationship. Don’t worry, you’re not alone! Relationships are tricky even under the best of circumstances. Add a little conflict to the mix and they can feel really unsettling.

Conflict is hard when you are with someone you care about. Oftentimes, emotions are put on overdrive and our ability to have any kind of meaningful conversation goes out the window. Or, we are so afraid of hurting others’ feelings that we back down entirely and start blaming ourselves.

As you move about this therapy, you will gain a greater understanding of why it is difficult for you to navigate differences, why conflict feels so devastating to you, and how to regulate your emotions so that you don’t feel so emotionally activated for so long after the conflict.

Sounds good? Great! Let’s get started!

The best way to understand the present is to look at the past. This will help you understand why you are having difficulty. Remember, every behavior stems from somewhere. Knowing where your behavior originated will help you make sense of what is going on now.

What follows are some questions to get you started. This will help you reflect on how the conflict was handled and resolved in your family. For example, were you told that your opinion doesn’t matter, that you didn’t know anything, etc? Did conflict resolve peacefully or did it cause rifts in relationships? Whatever it is for you, I want you to write it down.",guided_journaling,"1.

"I procrastinate. I may have the time to start or finish something, but I choose not to do it, then I get mad at myself","If you find yourself putting off tasks until the last minute, or even avoiding them altogether, it could be really frustrating. I understand. Procrastination is a habit that can make us disappointed, stressed, and anxious. Everyone procrastinates at some point. In this mini-therapy, we will explore the reasons for procrastination and provide some tips to help you deal with it effectively. Let’s go.

At this point, it's important to understand why you procrastinate. Consider this - If you feel overwhelmed or distracted by tasks at hand, afraid of making mistakes, or even realize that you have high expectations of yourself, you may find it difficult to complete tasks. Why? There could be many reasons why you procrastinate, including fear, lack of motivation, and distractions, among others.

"I feel like I'm worthless. Worthless because I don't feel like I do things right. I fear that I'll make mistakes when doing tasks, which only confirms my feelings of worthlessness","Hi, I'm glad you’re here! What you are struggling with resonates with so many people. That feeling of worthlessness has such a stronghold, doesn’t it? And then fear of failure creeps in and before you know it, it feels like you are diving head first into a shallow pond.

Okay, so that is a weird visual, but not entirely off the mark right?

The point is, you must be feeling pretty overwhelmed with this cycle of feeling worthless, and fear of failure, leading to more feelings of worthlessness.

I am here to help you understand a little more about where this feeling of worthlessness comes from, and how to face it and move toward the things that matter to you.

I know you feel apprehensive right now. Do you know how I know that? Because you fear failure, which means trying new things is super scary. But the fact that you are facing that fear right now just by being here says a lot about your desire to change that.

The first thing I want you to do is to challenge yourself to release any story you might be telling yourself that this won’t work. This will be challenging, or you might fail. I’m going to give you a mantra to repeat to yourself throughout this therapy and really, throughout your life when you start questioning yourself.",practice_affirmations,"Even though I fear failing, I fully accept myself for who I am.

"Sometimes, I feel really bad, like something is off. It makes me nauseous and vomit, and I cry too","What we feel emotionally is also felt physically. But sometimes, the physical experience can be intense and scary. Nausea, vomiting, and even uncontrollable crying are all distress signs - a plea for comfort. But, they can make us feel even more anxious, especially when they are intense, and seem uncontrollable. This is a vicious cycle.

We have anxious thoughts and feelings; we start feeling weird in the body; this makes us worry even more and our anxious thoughts and feelings become more intense; we try to stop it all but when that doesn’t work, we feel even more terrible, if that’s possible.

That’s a lot.

Let’s take a moment to center ourselves before we move forward. Our breath is a vital tool we can use to regulate ourselves. For most people, deep breathing while anxious helps them release some intensity. For some, however, it may make it momentarily more intense. However, inculcating a daily breathwork practice helps.

Today, I will take you through something called ‘box breathing’. This technique commonly benefits individuals who experience physical anxiety symptoms by slowing down their breathing and distracting them with counting.

As you breathe in, hold, and out, silently count to five.

Let’s begin…",practice_breathing,breathing_5_x_5_x_5_x_5,guided_journaling,In what situations does this discomfort occur? Think of the last few incidents and look for a pattern.,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought that people will judge me if I quit my job because I wasn't good at it or wasn't making enough money. At least once a year, I feel exhausted and lose interest in work","We all have certain expectations when it comes to a job. We all have an intent behind our job choices. It could be a passion, a purpose, an identity for ourselves, and most of all a meaning to the life we would live. As soon as the job we seek fails to meet those expectations, we feel stuck. We do the same work, but it doesn’t make us feel empowered but rather drained and exhausted. We lose our interest as it is probably no longer serving the purpose that you expected it to.

Before we move any further, how about we address the exhaustion you feel now?

Close your eyes and observe your breathing.

Do not try to rhythm your breathing or exercise them. Let it be. Notice the air you breathe in, the path it takes, and the way you release your breath.

But for reasons I can't quite understand, I find it difficult to take this route","I completely understand the burden and exhaustion you must feel with taking so much responsibility on your shoulders. After all, we all have limited capacities, and functioning beyond a limit can be overwhelming.

On one hand, being a responsible human being is a good thing. It shows that you are reliable, accountable, and caring. However, if we push ourselves too far, by taking on other people's tasks, saying yes to everything, & blaming ourselves for everything that goes wrong, it might come at the cost of our needs.

Owning your mistakes and blunders can be a sign of maturity. However, owning up to other people's feelings, tasks, responsibilities, & mistakes is a sign of over-responsibility. This might lead you to be taken for granted by others. It is necessary to say 'No' to certain things if it comes at your expense.

I can completely understand that taking too many responsibilities and completing them might make you feel satisfied at the end of the day because it could help you feel confident about yourself, could please people around you; however, do you realize that these responsibilities make you feel so exhausted, overwhelmed and it may hardly give you any time for yourself?

This entire experience has left you wondering if you even matter in the workplace unless you make a mistake.

As part of an organization, we have certain expectations of the workplace. It's important to us that we're acknowledged for our work and contributions to the larger cause, as well as that the organization takes care of us in return. Not feeling supported can be quite an unpleasant experience for us.

It is only human to feel this way.

According to Abraham Maslow, a humanistic psychologist, humans have a basic need for love and belonging that determines their behavior. Thus, it becomes imperative that the workplace also fulfills this need by making us feel like we matter.

If it is not, setting boundaries and communicating our needs assertively becomes more critical.

The tricky thing about forgiveness is that sometimes we let it hinge on an apology for or acknowledgment of the hurt the other person has caused us. But we may or may not get it. It may be too painful for a parent to acknowledge that they’ve hurt their child, especially if they haven’t done it intentionally. They may feel embarrassed or ashamed to the point of denying the pain they caused.

So, with compassion for that, let’s work through your need to forgive.

When we hold anger, disappointment, or resentment for someone, it can be really heavy and bog us down. Despite our best efforts, it may show up in our relationship with them. We may even misdirect these feelings to other areas of our life.

"Living away from my parents, the memories that pain me the most are the loudest","Ironically, our pain too needs a safe space.

There’s always a different reason that makes me feel anxious and nauseous and I’m struggling a bit to really understand the issue,"Anxiety often shows up when we feel threatened by or fearful of something. This can be something happening at a particular time, or something we anticipate. Sometimes, anxiety can also show up when we’re in a situation that reminds us of something that happened in the past. In any case, when we feel anxious, there is a voice inside that tells us we need to look out for ourselves. For this reason, anxiety can actually be an adaptive and welcome response.

Let me explain with an example - say you were in a bar with a few of your friends. Next to you, a bunch of guys were hanging out together, having a heated conversation. Soon enough, the conversation turns into a fistfight, and you feel scared for your safety. This incident might leave you feeling uncomfortable every time someone gets into a quarrel. It might not turn into a full-blown brawl, but you fear it nonetheless.

"I don’t feel like going out at all. I don’t feel like picking up phone calls, whether from my parents or friends. I won’t callback anyone unless I really have to. I just don’t talk to people much","Hi there 😊 Please to meet you.

I see how talking to people overwhelms you, possibly exaggerating your emotional fatigue. You are right, sometimes engaging with people can deplete us of our energy; therefore, isolation is a preferred course of action for the body. This is a very normal response to stressors, in your case arising from work, personal life, and relationships. This is not a “bad” feeling to encounter and doesn't make you a bad person. Emotions are neither good nor bad, but neutral and merely a response. When we are going through a sensory overload, even exposing ourselves to an environment other than our home space (familiarity) can feel too much for our bodies.

Perhaps, you feel obligated to get in touch with friends and families but on the other hand, it also tells me that you could be setting realistic expectations with yourself/people about your boundary system, that “you will get in touch with people if you really have to”. It shows you might be open to negotiation and consider how sometimes our boundaries can affect people around us. Have I read that right?

I am so glad you are here; it means you are one step closer to understanding and managing your anxiety.

It must be tough and scary to experience such physical symptoms like nausea and light-headedness, especially when it is difficult to pinpoint why you are having these reactions. Anxiety can be a little bully sometimes, can’t it?

The fact that you are here tells me that you are motivated to empower yourself so that anxiety becomes more manageable and you can do the things that you want to do.

"I don’t know why I self-sabotage, I’m lost. It’s like an innate characteristic I can’t get rid off","Interesting that you call your self-sabotaging tendencies an ‘innate characteristic’. Self-sabotage is in fact the manifestation of something deeper - so not really an innate characteristic we can’t get rid of. But of course, it can feel like that because it’s so heavy, especially when we don’t understand where it comes from.

I’ve always found it fascinating that many of our problems seem to become lighter when we understand where they come from. That’s the power of knowledge and insight.

Think of it this way - let’s say you’ve been tasked with sending a voice message to a friend using a brand-new phone, and an app you’ve never heard of before. It’s all frustratingly unfamiliar, and nothing works. You throw your hands up and decide that this new technology is inherently impossible to navigate. Then, your techie friend comes in and shows you the ropes. Once you know how to use the gadget or app, it won't be as frustrating as it was before. It doesn’t have that power over you anymore.

Our feelings and thoughts also work in this way. When we don’t understand their mechanics, they can be frustrating! When we gain insight, we escape them. They no longer control us.

So let’s try to understand your self-sabotaging tendencies.

I'll ask you a series of questions. If these are a lot for you to answer right away, that’s okay. You don’t have to answer them all. Consider these suggestions as something you can do in your own time.",guided_journaling,"What kind of self-sabotaging behavior do you find yourself exhibiting? This can include procrastination, unhealthy habits, defensiveness, undermining your worth, perfectionism, etc.",practice_awareness,"Let’s break it down by different aspects of your life.

You can pause this mini-therapy and fill out the sheet now. Or you can return later. Either way, it is okay.",practice_awareness,"So, sit in a comfortable position. Try to keep your back straight.

Emotionally I just lose control at some point. I have a hard time figuring out emotions and I don't feel a lot of emotions other than anger,"Hello there, I’m so glad that you have taken the time to work with me to help manage your anger. Let me just start off by saying, boy do I feel you! Sometimes when I have too many emotions running on at once, the only one I can grab onto is anger. Then I find myself wanting to punch walls and scream from rooftops.

But that rarely works, usually, because it is not necessarily anger that I am feeling. Anger is the only way I know to manifest all other emotions. We can all understand the anger. We have all experienced it, expressed it, and felt the brunt of it.

I would say that anger, happiness, and sadness are the three emotions that are the most tangible, would you agree? So we tend to put all other emotions into the category of one of these three.

The problem is that they don’t always fit into one of those categories. And then we try to be seen and heard, but ultimately not really feel understood. This leaves us feeling less seen and less heard, causing more anger. It’s a vicious cycle.

Does this sound like you? It certainly sounds like me!

Here’s what we will do together.

1. I will help you understand what your anger is trying to tell you
2. I will help you identify other emotions than anger you might be feeling
3. I will help you understand how your anger might be serving you.
4. I will walk you through some exercises that will help you regulate your body, bringing you to a calmer place.

"I have trouble sleeping at night, I always sleep really late and then get up really late the following day","Hello, welcome to your safe space. Let us use this space to build a healthy lifestyle.

Most of us desire peaceful and consistent sleep as it is an essential aspect of our lifestyle. I can completely understand your frustration about not being able to fall asleep at night and wake up early. It must be so frustrating and difficult for you to struggle with sleeping every night. Poor quality sleep can drain our energy levels, and affect our performance and quality of life.

"I’m feeling triggered right now, what do I do?","Triggers. Yuck. I hate them. They send us into a place full of uncertainty and fear. If we are not careful, before we know it we can find ourselves paralyzed to do anything or avoid all situations that may induce triggers.

Does this sound like what you are experiencing?

First, I want you to know that triggers are normal human experiences created by a stressor that causes an emotional response. Triggers usually bring on more intense emotions, and usually uncomfortable ones, like anxiety or fear.

We all experience triggers because we are all human. I say this to help you know that triggers in and of themselves are not to be feared. What stops us in our tracks is our own reaction to the trigger.

My guess is that when you feel triggered you either want to avoid the situation all together or if you are already in the situation, you want to do anything you can to get out of it.

Both responses are normal. However, they might not help you manage future situations. Avoidance creates more discomfort.

"I really attempt to be put together, but I feel behind in life. I just wish I was perfect in terms of having things planned out and hitting certain milestones ""on time”","Pediatricians often see something called ‘milestone anxiety’ among new parents in their practice. New parents are concerned about their kids learning to walk, talk, read, and write at the appropriate time. This is understandable because it is rooted in biology and enough research demonstrates that there is in fact an appropriate time to achieve developmental milestones.

But when, as adults, we experience milestone anxiety, it is not rooted in any biological or scientific expectation or explanation. It is rooted in social or cultural expectations to achieve certain goals at a certain age. The problem with this is that cultural expectations are often not set in stone. They are malleable and negotiable. They are ‘should bes’ that can become ‘maybe nots’, and not meeting social, interpersonal, or financial goals “on time” doesn’t always imply that we are inadequate.

But yes, it’s easier said than done.

Before we explore your discomfort, let’s take a moment to scan where in your body you feel it. Close your eyes and scan your body from your head to your toes. Do you notice any tightness? Pain? Tense muscles? Take note of these things, and as you exhale, imagine the uncomfortable sensations leaving your body.

"I push everyone away that gets too close and just self-sabotage. I don't seem to be able to stick to some of my relationships for very long, because I don't let them in","Hi there!

It sounds like you're walking with walls around you. There is a part of you that wants these walls to break down - this is the part that maybe removes one brick here, one there, allowing for a little bit of closeness, a relationship for a short while. But, if it gets too much, if there's too much coming in through these gaps, something in you tells you to put the bricks back up and close the walls again.

You don't want to let anybody into this safe little cave you've created for yourself, even though it might get a little lonely and suffocating in here all by yourself.

When we can tolerate only a little bit of closeness, only for a short while, it suggests we have an inner conflict. We want it, but also, we don't. The part that wants it is acting from a natural, healthy need for companionship, love, and belongingness.

Let's explore the part that pushes everyone away.

I am going to ask you a series of questions. Try to answer them to the best of your ability, but if you need more time, that's okay. You can come back here anytime to continue your reflection.",guided_journaling,"At what point does it start feeling 'too much'? Too close, or too long?",practice_awareness,"Imagine that tonight, while you're asleep, a miracle happens and someone breaks down this wall around you. The parts of you that feel undeserving of closeness and love. The fears that hold you back. When you wake up tomorrow, you won't have this wall around you.

And you have closeness, intimacy, and a sense of belongingness and safety in a long-term relationship.

I experienced intense parentification growing up. I took the responsibility for my parent’s feelings and I was often more of a parent to them than them being a parent to me,"Hi there! I am so glad to see you here. It takes a lot of courage to show up for yourself! My goal is to help you feel validated and seen as you work your way through this therapy.

Growing up in an environment where you were the emotional caretaker of your parents is not fair. As a child, it is never your responsibility to take on the role of a parent. I am so sorry that this happened to you.

Before we get started, make sure that you are seated in a comfortable position. Maybe grab a hot cup of tea, coffee, or water. The more comfortable you are, the more your body can relax and allow you to be present.

"Self-hatred is my biggest concern right now. I wish I could deal with it somehow, but I’m just stuck on it. Even when I try working through it, I automatically get back to my negative thoughts, so I just give up","Self-hatred is a strong word! And a strong feeling, too, I imagine.

Negative thoughts can take many forms. They feel automatic when unchecked and unexamined. We’ll examine these thoughts today, together.

But before that, let’s take a moment to ground ourselves. This will help us explore the discomfort with clarity and calm.

Let’s do this by practicing an ‘anchoring phrase’. In one to three sentences, describe your surroundings.

For example, my anchoring phrase right now would be - ‘I am sitting in a beautiful coworking cafe, and it’s raining outside. It’s quiet except for the sound of rain and people typing away on their laptops.’

Long-distance relationships are challenging, aren’t they? Through no fault of your own, or your partner’s, this external circumstance limits how you can show up in the relationship. I respect your acknowledgment of the fact that you may not be able to fulfill all of your partner’s needs. Long-distance or not, it is not possible for one person to be everything to their partner.

"I sometimes feel like my partner will cheat on me, even when it’s irrational and I have no logical reason to feel so","Hi there, welcome to your mini-therapy! So, you have been experiencing feelings of anxiety and insecurity in your relationship. I understand that you have been feeling like your partner might cheat on you. This is even when you know it's irrational and you have no logical reason to feel that way. It can be really challenging to deal with these feelings, but I'm here to help you work through them.

First of all, I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable for you to have trust issues given your past experiences of being cheated on. It's normal to feel anxious or even worried about your current relationship, even if your partner hasn’t given you any reasons to doubt them.

But, at the same time, it’s imperative to understand that your past experiences don’t necessarily define your current relationship.

Trust is one of the most important things in a relationship and you deserve a healthy, trusting and secure relationship. So, let's explore what your needs are to feel safe and secure in your relationship.",reflective_questions,"What are your expectations of your partner?

"I’m going through some huge transitions right now. So, everything feels very shaky in my life, as if there are no roots","Hello there 😊

This transition sounds like it's been tough on you. I understand the confusion that comes with a shaky ground. It is okay to feel this way during a transition!

To some, sudden or continuous changes can over-stimulate their sense organs. This feeling that everything is “shaky”, and we are about to fall, usually stems from anxiety in times of extreme unpredictability. More like a sinking sand effect, have I got that right?

However, when our body goes through bouts of “shakiness” and “root-lessness”, as first-aid, it is necessary to shift our focus to reducing the effects of anxiety to better navigate the confusion. Please know that anxious feelings and thoughts cannot be stopped or eradicated from the human system. What you and I can do is reduce anxiety effects (such as confusion and shakiness) to better support yourself through this transition.

Let’s do a small exercise that could lead to a sense of calm.",practice_awareness,"Perhaps we can begin by paying attention to this feeling of shakiness. Let’s allow ourselves to feel it. Tell yourself, “This feeling is okay to have, it makes me human.” Take some time to soak in that thought.

When you are ready, let's name this “feeling of shakiness"".

Where do you feel shakiness in your body?

Observe which part of your body this emotion is making its presence known. Tell yourself it’s an emotion, you are not your emotion, and this is your body’s way of responding to something unpleasant. Now, take a deep breath in, hold, and exhale.

Let’s continue to keep in touch with this emotion.

Picture this emotion as a wave, where you can float in it, or ride on it to the shore. You are not your emotions. Youremotions don’t make you an unworthy person. It is a response to a stimulus.

Bring your attention to the present. Shift your attention to your breath. It is your anchor; it calms your agitated nervous system. Listen to how you inhale and exhale. When this feeling comes back, let yourself know that it’s okay. Feelings do exactly that, they come and go.

"I always thought that once I reach a certain compensation package or title, I would be really happy and my job would become less exhausting. But, with more money and better title and recognition also.. nothing really changes","Hi there!

Anticipation of something is often more intense than how it unfolds. When we expect something to make us really happy, or really sad, we often find that our actual experience of it is a few notches lower.

But, I suspect there’s more to your unhappiness than unrealistic expectations. You have met certain goals, and you have more money, and a better title… but it doesn’t feel as good as you thought it would. I understand that. I’ve experienced something similar - a sense of emptiness after meeting a huge goal I had set for myself.

Here’s what happens when we work focused on a goal - our body and mind enter a state of stress. You see, stress is not always negative. There is something called ‘U-stress’ or ‘positive-stress’ - it’s that sense of anxiety or nervousness before an exam or major presentation that pushes you to work harder. Even though positive stress helps you achieve your goals, it is still stress. And when you finally meet that goal, instead of the satisfaction you anticipated feeling, you end up feeling exhausted… BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD FOR SO LONG!

I want to learn how to trust myself and not abandon myself when things get rough,"Hello. Welcome to your safe space. I am so glad to see you taking care of yourself.

Learning how to trust yourself and believe in yourself is one of the most essential aspects of healthy and happy living.

Staying true to yourself in a world where people's opinions and expectations dominate the mind can be challenging. It is critical to regain our self confidence in the event of a setback or a mess up.

When you want to trust yourself, the journey begins from within. It is all about looking inward despite demands, expectations, and setbacks. It is not selfish to priortize one's desires and be your own authority. It is a crucial element of a fulfilling life.

Trusting oneself means looking after one's needs and safety. Treating yourself with love and compassion irrespective of what happens. You love your family and friends even when they mess up. You understand them. This kind of love and understanding is all that you need rather than striving for perfection because no one is perfect in this world. Refusing to give up on yourself even when nothing is right is self-trust.

Sometimes, lack of self trust can also happen when your parents have often fixed your problems or taken care of your responsibilities. This has not really given you a chance to take responsibility and test your capabilities.

Family, community, and society expect us to be a certain kind of person. This pressure to wear a mask may also make us feel that our original personality isn't good enough.

You are not alone in having a hard time trusting yourself. As we grow up, because we are humans, we all make mistakes, receive negative opinions, experience setbacks and failures. These experiences are bound to create difficulties withestablishing self-confidence. As adults, it is our job to navigate through these experiences and build a realistic perspective. We must also challenge our negative baggage. Our problem, however, is that there are some of us who believe in the baggage rather than challenging it, which makes it very difficult.

Friends are like passengers on parallel trains sticking their hands out to each other, enjoying this wild ride!

Friends come in all shapes and sizes. Some, we may have shared interests and activities we can do together. Others, we may like to have around to party. And there are a selected few with whom we can develop deeper bonds. They become people we can lean on, and seek support from in times of need.

"When something bad happens I feel anxious. I don't feel like it's okay..like there's something telling me that I'll never be happy and content, and the idea of being happy, is just alien to me","Hey, it's only natural to wish for good things in our lives. And it makes sense to feel out of control and anxious when things don’t work in our favor. Anxiety as an emotion, when unchecked, can push us into thinking in a self-critical manner. We may also tend to blow things out of proportion, magnify the possibility of something bad happening to us and truly believe them to be true. I understand. Your emotions are real and a natural response to the situation.

It takes so much insight and courage to acknowledge, express and reach out for support. I'm glad you're here. Together, we'll work to understand the cause behind your discomfort, how it's impacting your well-being and eventually learn some tools and techniques to cope with it.

Let's begin ♥️

The biopsychosocial model of anxiety proposed by Georgy Engel, says that whenever we feel anxious, our brain, in particular a part of the brain called the amygdala, sends a warning-like signal against real or imagined danger to us. Our body then reacts by gathering energy to deal with the real or imagined danger or pushing it away to avoid discomfort. We also lack the ability to problem solve and make informed decisions when we are anxious. But there is still a way of gaining control over the brain and sending a safety message back to it. You can do this by controlling your breath when anxious. Here's why it works. Our bodies natural response to danger is by increasing our heart-rate, breathing, tensing our muscles to fight or run. And so conscious deep breathing helps us send a message of safety and well-being. A well-researched breathing tool for anxiety is called the '4-7-8 breathing technique'.

Slowly breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and slowly relax and breathe out through your mouth for 8 seconds. This is like blowing a balloon.

"I’ve begun to feel jealous because my partner has been looking at other people, and I don’t get how he could, because he often said he couldn't imagine how I could ever be with him","Hi there!

A very fascinating thing about human emotions is that every feeling serves a purpose. In some way or another, everything we experience - even the unpleasant stuff - is trying to protect us in some way.

Jealousy comes up when we feel threatened. In a romantic partnership, it comes up if we fear that particular behavior or person is pulling our partner away from us. In those moments when your partner’s eyes and mind wander away from you and to another person, he IS away from you.

When you feel jealous at that time, it’s good to pay attention to it because that feeling tells you, ‘Hey, something’s wrong here. You gotta make sure you don’t lose this relationship or person.’
